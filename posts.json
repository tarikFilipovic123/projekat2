While it's not as posh as the Mercedes-AMG C63 or as lithe as the Cadillac CT4-V Blackwing, the Alfa brings a massive serving of passion to the table, all the better to charm its driver into clipping apexes on even the most routine commutes."

        "content": "The Alfa Romeo Giulietta Quadrifoglio Verde Cloverleaf is among the prettiest of hot hatchbacks and sounds fruity too, but that’s where its class-leading qualities end. Expensive, numb to drive and happy only on the smoothest of roads, we say roll on the new era of rear-drive Alfas instead."

        "content": "From its launch in 2009, the styling of this hot hatch MiTo was generally beefed up to reflect the car's sporting prowess with more aggressive bumpers, 17” alloy wheels, bespoke wing mirrors and Cloverleaf badges on the front wings. All of which works well with unique styling that could belong to no other marque, from the serpent-eating-baby badge on the shield-shaped front grille to the rounded jewel-like LED tail lights."
